# cum-engine

A crossplatform engine to be written in rust/c++ with the goal of prototyping graphics applications and reducing the code needed to get something running to the absolute minimum, as well as keeping the compile time as low as is reasonable.

## Platforms
### likely
* Linux
* Windows
* Webasm
### unlikely
* Mac
## Status
* This readme is as long than the amount of code the engine has, i'd even say it is infinitely times longer
